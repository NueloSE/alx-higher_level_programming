#### This repository contains programs created with the intention of understanding Higher level programming and algorithms using PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE to solve common programming task during my SOFTWARE ENGINEERING studies @ ALX_SE cohort 21

## Technologies
- Files are compiled using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files are written according to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- Scripts are written in #!/usr/bin/python3
	- The first line of all your python scripts files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
	- The first line of all your shell scripts files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
	- All scripts are executable

## Description

This repository encompasses code written for higher-level programming languages during the ALX Software Engineering course in collaboration with Holberton School of Computer Science. Through these projects, I have gained proficiency in the Python programming language, applying the acquired skills to address various tasks, all meticulously documented within this repository. Concurrently, I have furthered my expertise in the C programming language and shell scripting, concurrently advancing my comprehension of Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository can serve as a valuable learning resource for aspiring software engineers.

## Prerequisite

This is a continuation of [alx_low_level_programming by Nuelo](https://github.com/NueloSE/alx-low_level_programming)
